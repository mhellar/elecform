                <p>
                    Our bodies are our primary interface for the world. Interactive systems that live on the body can be intimate, upfront, and sometimes quite literally in your face. They sit close to your skin, inhabit your clothing, and sometimes even start to feel like part of you. This makes wearable electronics an exciting, challenging, and inspiring area to work in.

                <p>
                    The terms “wearable technology“, “wearable devices“, and “wearables” all refer to electronic technologies or computers that are incorporated into items of clothing and accessories which can comfortably be worn on the body.

            <p>Korean collective Shinseungback Kimyonghun have created ‘Aposematic Jacket’ a wearable computer for self-defense. The lenses on the jacket give off the warning signal, “I can record you”, to prevent possible attack. When the wearer pushes a button under threat, the jacket records the scene in 360 degrees and sends the images to the Web.</p>

                <h2>Experiment: Imagined Wearable</h2>
                <p>
                    An experiment? That’s right! The best time for you to start prototyping wearable electronics is right now. Sometimes it’s easier to work through ideas before you even know what technologies you might use to create them.

                <h2>Experiment: Imagined Wearable</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine something intended to be worn on your body (a garment or accessory) that would help you better relate to the world around you. It could be something practical, possible, or desirable. Or it could be something ridiculous,Beautiful outlandish, annoying, or invasive. The technology that your garment utilizes does not have to actually exist and can be one of your own invention.

                <h2>Experiment: Imagined Wearable</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you’ve imagined your wearable, create a physical, wearable prototype or mock up that demonstrates what it might look like and how it would work. To make it, you can modify something that already exists (t-shirt, sneakers, top hat, etc.) or create something new from raw materials. It doesn’t have to be fancy. Sometimes paper, duct tape, and Sharpies will do just fine.

                    This is a conceptual prototype—you do not need to implement any technology. Instead, focus on the design of the piece as well as the story behind it. Feel free to be creative, playful, and inventive. Try creating supporting materials such as instructions for use or user scenarios to help develop the story of your wearable.

                    <p>Most of us know what a computer looks like. It usually has a keyboard, monitor, CPU (Central Processing Unit), printer, and a mouse. These types of computers, like the Mac or PC, are primarily designed to communicate (or “interface”) with humans.</p>

                    <p>There are also little computers all around us, running program and quietly doing calculations, not interacting with humans at all. These computers are in your car, on the Space Shuttle, in a toy, and maybe even inside your hairdryer.</p>
