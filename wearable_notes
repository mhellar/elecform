Just as the abacus was a precursor to the modern computer, the abacus ring was the forefather of today's wearables. This marvellous 17th-century Chinese implement allowed bean counters to perform mathematical tasks without using the written word, instead moving tiny beads along nine rows - and there were no issues with battery life either.

The first truly wearable computer didn't appear until 1961 - and, of course, it was created to help a pair of cunning mathematicians cheat at roulette. Edward O. Thorpe and Claude Shannon concealed a timing device in a shoe which could fairly accurately predict where the ball would land on a roulette table. The number was communicated via radio waves to the gambler with a great deal of success - Thorpe reported a 44 per cent increase of winning bets. Other mathematicians developed similar machines, proving so successful that the state of Nevada - where Las Vegas resides - passed a law prohibiting them in 1985.

Mass production of the microchip in the 1980s brought with it the potential to create smaller and lighter computers than ever before. Steve Mann, a researcher and inventor specialising in electronic photography, began his EyeTap project in the early 1980s. At the time it was clunky and made the wearer look like a motorcyclist who'd been a pretty unfortunate event with a television, but the idea itself was astounding. Mann wanted to create a machine that would record what the user saw through their right eye, while allowing them to see through it at the same time. Over the past few decades Mann has gradually whittled it down to a sleek and simple headset which looks rather a lot like Google Glass.
